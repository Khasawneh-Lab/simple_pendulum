# simple_pendulum

This repo contains (or links to) the simulation Python code, CAD, model, BOM, mechanical drawings, equations, and parameters for a manufactured single pendulum. A CAD rendering of the model is provided below.

## Download

The CAD will soon be available through GrabCad.

## Usage and Documentation

Full documentation of the pendulum is provided [here](https://github.com/Khasawneh-Lab/simple_pendulum/blob/master/simple_pendulum_documentation.pdf).

This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant numbers CMMI-1759823 and DMS1759824. 

Disclaimer: Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.

## Simulation Documentation
For simulating the single pendulum, we developed a Python function that will include an optional magnetic repsulive force (see documentation) and base excitation. If the appropriate parameters are set to zero, then the simulation will be that of a free simple pendulum. The Python code implementing the example output shown below if available [here](https://github.com/Khasawneh-Lab/simple_pendulum/blob/master/simple_pendulum_documentation.pdf).
