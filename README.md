# simple_pendulum

This repo contains (or links to) the simulation Python code, CAD, model, BOM, mechanical drawings, equations, and parameters for a manufactured single pendulum. Please cite this page through our published works "[Uncertainty Propagation of System Parameters to the Dynamic Response: An Application to a Benchtop Pendulum](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-abstract/IMECE2017/58387/V04BT05A052/288563)" or (soon to be published in ASME) "Dynamic State Analysis of a Driven Pendulum using Complex Networks." A CAD rendering of the model is shown below. Additionally, you can cite the code used here through our [zenodo account](https://zenodo.org/record/3727800#.XnzQxzFKiUk).

## Download

The CAD is available through GrabCad [here](https://grabcad.com/library/simple-pendulum-research-or-educational-purposes-1).

## Usage and Documentation

Full documentation of the pendulum is provided [here](https://github.com/Khasawneh-Lab/simple_pendulum/blob/master/simple_pendulum_documentation.pdf).

This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant numbers CMMI-1759823 and DMS1759824.

## Simulation
For simulating the single pendulum, we developed a Python function that will include an optional magnetic repsulive force (see documentation) and base excitation. If the appropriate parameters are set to zero, then the simulation will be that of a free simple pendulum. The Python code implementing the example output shown below is available [here](https://github.com/Khasawneh-Lab/simple_pendulum/blob/master/simulation/single_pendulum_simulation.py).
